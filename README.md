# Development

This is the future of Micro.

# Overview 

Micro is the simplest way to build microservices. Our goal is to continue on this mission in an open and collaborative way 
with the community. Up until now most of our ideas and development have revolved around discussions in Slack. This useful 
for realtime discussion so we can move quickly but it often means not everyone gets to contribute to this or we don't 
have a history for others to go back and look at to understand how we got to where we are.

This repo serves as an open forum for long term design ideas, collaboration and ultimately the roadmap for Micro.

## Roadmap

We'll add this real soon!
